AniWatch - Android Anime Streaming App
======================================

A feature-rich Android application for streaming anime content, inspired by the user experience of YouTube and Netflix. This project was built during my early Android development journey as a learning exercise to understand mobile app development, API integration, and UI/UX design patterns.

üì± Overview
-----------

AniWatch provides anime enthusiasts with a seamless streaming experience, featuring a modern interface that combines YouTube's familiar navigation with Netflix's content discovery approach. The app aggregates anime content from multiple sources and presents it in an intuitive, user-friendly manner.

**Note**: This was one of my early Android projects (3rd app) built for learning purposes. The code reflects the development practices and libraries available 4+ years ago, and serves as a good reference for understanding traditional Android development approaches before modern architectural patterns like MVVM became standard.
